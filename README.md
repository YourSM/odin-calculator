# odin-calculator
This is a project for the Odin Project Curriculum
where I created a functioning calculator!

The calculator has the usual options a real one
and is designed with a pastel theme.

This project showcases all I have learned so far
in the curriculum, including HTML, CSS, and
elements of JS including functions,
DOM manipulation, and event listeners among
other skills!
